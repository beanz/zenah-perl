Copy the sample database to the default location;

  cp -p zenah.sample.db zenah.db

To start the test server on http://hostname:3000/ run:

  perl -Iblib/lib blib/script/zenah_server.pl

THERE IS NO AUTHENTICATION IN THE SERVER CODE SO MAKE SURE IT IS FIREWALLED.

In another terminal, start the xPL rules engine with:

  perl -Iblib/lib blib/script/zenah
