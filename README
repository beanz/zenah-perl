Copy the sample database to the default location;

  cp -p zenah.sample.db zenah.db

CAUTION:

 1) The rules engine will react to and send x10.basic message.  The
    sample database uses appliances on house code a, lamps on house codes
    j, k and l, motion sensors on house code m and an RF remote on house
    code b.

 2) There is *NO* authentication on the web interface so be sure it is
    firewalled.

To start the test server on http://hostname:3000/ run:

  perl -Iblib/lib blib/script/zenah_server.pl

In another terminal, start the xPL rules engine with:

  export LATITUDE=51  # alter as appropriate for your location
  export LONGITUDE=-1
  perl -Iblib/lib blib/script/zenah
